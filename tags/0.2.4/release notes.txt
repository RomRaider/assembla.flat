Enginuity is a full featured Engine Control Unit editing application for tuning SSP2 Subarus, meant to be used in conjuction with datalogging and ECU flash and dump utilities. Enginuity will give you full control over timing, fuel, boost and many other parameters in your ECU, competing with very expensive and proprietary software. Enginuity will remove your need for piggyback systems designed to control these functions, and, in most cases, work as well as any stand alone engine management. Reflashing your stock ECU also has the added benefit of a manufacturer tested base map, giving you top notch performance and saving time tuning idle and low throttle applications.

You must have version 1.5.0 of the Java Runtime Environment installed! It is available from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp under the name JDK 5.0 Update 5.

Enginuity is currently in ALPHA TEST status, meaning it is untested and not intended for use by inexperienced users. In addition to being incomplete and untested, only experienced tuners with the required tools (ie, wideband oxygen sensor) should modify an ECU image. As with any engine management, changes could result in severe engine damage. Use at your own risk.

Until Enginuity reaches a mature point, releases will be quite frequent and will usually contain significant changes. However, some times I may release a revision to add a single feature I'd like users to have, or maybe just to add a certain ECU version. Until more features are complete, version support will be quite limited. If you'd like your ECU version to be added, please visit openecu.org and post a message in the Technical Tuning Software forum, with your image attached.

0.2.4a Release Notes
--------------------
Includes are now working much better than they were in 0.2.3a. Adding more definitions should be much more intuitive, and I plan on adding a good number before doing any more development. Coarse and absolute value input will make tuning more user friendly and faster. Also, the 160kb/192kb difference in ROMs dumped with and without RAM sectors is now accounted for, rather than just 192kb images. We're getting close to a stable release.


Changes:
--------
0.2.4a (3/21/2006)
------------------
- "Base" attribute for extending/duplicating tables
- "Omit" attribute not required to omit tables -- just set storageaddress to "0"
- Fine and coarse adjustment of values
- Direct value input
- Support for ROMs with or without RAM sectors


0.2.3a (2/27/2006)
------------------
- ECU definitions including each other (endless loop) is now handled
- "Omit" attribute allows incomplete tables to be removed from inheriting definitions
