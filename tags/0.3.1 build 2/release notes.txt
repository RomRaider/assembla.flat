Enginuity is a full featured Engine Control Unit editing application for tuning virtually any manufacturer, meant to be used in conjuction with datalogging and ECU flash and dump utilities. Enginuity will give you full control over timing, fuel, boost and many other parameters in your ECU, competing with very expensive and proprietary software. Enginuity will remove your need for piggyback systems designed to control these functions, and, in most cases, work as well as or better than any stand alone engine management. Reflashing your stock ECU also has the added benefit of a manufacturer tested base map, giving you top notch performance and saving time tuning idle and low throttle applications.

Enginuity is currently in BETA TEST status, meaning it is not thoroughly tested and not intended for use by inexperienced users. In addition to being incomplete and untested, only experienced tuners with the required tools (ie, wideband oxygen sensor) should modify an ECU image. As with any engine management, changes could result in severe engine damage. Use at your own risk.

As of version 0.2.92a, source files are no longer included with the binary distribution of Enginuity. The source is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/enginuity via Subversion.


0.3.1 Notes (7/9/2006)
-----------------------
This version is a moderate facelift over 0.3.0, includes an updated ECU definitions file, and fixes several minor bugs. No new major features are present, but many minor additions, listed in the changes below, are worth noticing. The most important new feature is userlevels, which will restrict access to certain tables you may feel uncomfortable modifying.
